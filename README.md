I had a really hard time implementing LabC with this project. I have made many one page apps in the past, however I was primarily using react native and tailwind for styling. For some reason, vite was really confusing and challenging for 
me to work with, primarily regarding converting my proto to a single-page app. Although this misses some course requirements, I'd be happy to try it again if it is not satisfactory. However, previous attempts were just destroying
a lot of my code. I am able to get a login page with the headers in, but the trips.html conversion was causing a plethora of problems.

To run:
cd into /server and type `npm run start`. Everything should be bundled in atecioro.unbundled.dev, however.
